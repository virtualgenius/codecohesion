## 🤔 Why CodeCohesion?

**Problem:** Understanding code architecture and cohesion is hard. Where are your bounded contexts? Which files are tightly coupled? How did your architecture evolve to its current state?

**Solution:** CodeCohesion turns git history into an interactive 3D visualization that reveals:
- 🔗 **Cohesion Patterns** - Which files belong together (bounded contexts)
- 🔥 **Coupling Hotspots** - Files that change together frequently
- 🏗️ **Architecture** - Hierarchical structure at a glance
- ⏳ **Evolution** - How your codebase grew and changed over time
- 👥 **Ownership** - Who works on what parts of the code

**Use Cases:**
- 📚 **DDD & Bounded Contexts** - Discover natural domain boundaries through cohesion
- 🔍 **Monolith Decomposition** - Identify where to split based on temporal coupling
- 🎓 **Onboarding** - Give new team members a visual architectural tour
- 📽️ **Retrospectives** - Watch timeline playback of how features evolved
- 💰 **Technical Debt** - Find legacy hotspots and coupling issues

## 🎯 Project Goals

Visualize code repositories to understand:
- **Repository structure** - Hierarchical organization at a glance
- **File relationships** - Parent-child connections and directory ownership
- **Code distribution** - File sizes mapped to lines of code
- **Recent activity** - See which files were recently modified
- **Team ownership** - Who last touched each file
- **File coupling** - Which files change together in commits

## ✨ Current Features

### Core Visualization
- **Solar System Layout** - Directories as planets, files as moons orbiting in 360° rings
- **Hierarchical Focus Mode** - Drill down into directories while maintaining context
- **Adaptive Sizing** - File sphere size represents lines of code, directories sized by total LOC
- **Smart Spacing** - Automatic layout prevents overlap using square-root scaling

### Interactive Exploration
- **Orbit Controls** - Left-click drag to rotate, right-click to pan, scroll to zoom
- **Click Navigation** - Click directories to focus, click again to navigate back up
- **Hover Highlighting** - Highlights files/directories and their ancestors on hover
- **Smooth Camera** - Stable camera framing without disorienting resets

### Git Metadata Visualization

#### Multiple Color Modes

Visualize the same codebase through different analytical lenses:

1. **File Type** (default) - 50+ file extensions with semantic color grouping
2. **Last Modified** - Adaptive time buckets showing recent changes
   - Active repos: 7 time intervals (last week → 1-2 years)
   - Stale repos: Percentile-based intervals with year ranges
3. **Author** - Consistent hash-based colors per contributor
4. **Churn (Lifetime Commits)** - Heatmap showing frequently modified files
5. **Contributors (Lifetime)** - Number of unique contributors per file
6. **File Age** - When files were first created (new → legacy)
7. **Recent Activity (90 days)** - Lines changed in recent window
8. **Code Stability** - Average lines changed per commit (stable → volatile)
9. **Recency** - Days since last modification (hot → cold)
10. **Lines of Code** - File size distribution with percentile-based buckets (small → large)
11. **Coupling Clusters** - Files grouped by temporal coupling (change together)

![Churn Mode on React Repository](docs/images/churn-mode-react.png)
*React repository (6,784 files) colored by commit frequency - red spheres indicate high-churn hotspots that may need refactoring*

![Recent Activity Mode](docs/images/activity-mode-cbioportal.png)
*cBioPortal repository with Recent Activity (90 days) coloring - shows which files have been actively developed*

![Last Modified Mode](docs/images/lastmod-mode-cbioportal.png)
*Same cBioPortal repository with Last Modified (Relative) coloring - reveals code age distribution from newest (green) to legacy (red)*

</details>

#### Intelligent Directory Coloring
- Directories show the **dominant color** of their files based on file count
- Works for all color modes (not just file type)
- Recursive aggregation - includes all nested files
- Updates when switching color modes

#### Commit Siblings Highlighting
- Click any file with "Highlight Commit" enabled
- See all files changed in the same commit (at HEAD)
- Dramatic visual highlighting with bright yellow glow
- Connection lines from highlighted files to parent directories
- Toggle to clear highlighting

#### Coupling Cluster Analysis
- **Temporal coupling detection** - Files that frequently change together
- **3D floating cards** - Hover over clustered files to see cluster details
- **Scrollable file lists** - View all files in each coupling cluster
- **Color-coded visualization** - Each cluster gets a unique color

### Timeline V2 - Repository Evolution Playback

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Analyze a Repository

```bash
cd processor
npm install
npm run dev -- /path/to/your/repository
```

This generates a JSON file in `processor/output/` with:
- Repository structure (hierarchical tree)
- Lines of code per file
- Git metadata (last modified date, last author, commit hash)

**Example repositories tested:**
- Gource (120 files, 28K LOC)
- React (6,784 files, 918K LOC)

### 2. Copy Data to Viewer

```bash
# The output is in processor/output/repo-data.json
# Copy it to viewer with a descriptive name
cp processor/output/repo-data.json viewer/public/data/my-repo.json
```

### 3. Start Viewer

```bash
cd viewer
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 (or http://localhost:3001 if port 3000 is in use)

### 4. Explore Your Codebase

**Mouse Controls:**
- **Left-click + drag** - Rotate camera around the visualization
- **Right-click + drag** - Pan the camera
- **Scroll wheel** - Zoom in/out
- **Click file/directory** - View details and drill down into directories

**UI Controls:**
- **Color Mode dropdown** - 11 visualization modes including Lines of Code and Coupling Clusters
- **Hide generated files** - Filter out build artifacts, minified files, and dependencies (dist/, build/, node_modules/, *.min.js, etc.)
- **Labels toggle** - Toggle directory labels between Always On and Hover Only
- **Repository selector** - Switch between different analyzed repositories
- **Highlight Commit** - Toggle commit siblings highlighting mode
- **Panel headers** - Click to collapse/expand Stats and Legend panels
- **Legend filtering** - Multi-select filtering by clicking legend items (works with all color modes)

## 🎨 Design Decisions

### Solar System Metaphor
Directories are planets, files are moons. This provides:
- Clear visual ownership (files orbit their parent directory)
- Natural scaling (any number of children can orbit in a full 360° ring)
- Intuitive navigation (zoom into planets to see their moons)

### Hierarchical Focus Mode
Instead of showing the entire tree at once (which creates visual chaos), the system shows:
- **Initial view:** Root + first-level directories (overview)
- **Focused view:** Selected directory + its children + full ancestor chain
- **Context preservation:** Always see where you are in the hierarchy

### Adaptive Color Modes
Rather than hard-coded time intervals, the Last Modified mode adapts:
- **Active repos** (80% files changed in last 90 days): Fine-grained intervals
- **Stale repos** (80% files older than 90 days): Percentile-based buckets showing actual year ranges

### Radial Layout Algorithm
- Full 360° circles (no angular subdivision constraints)
- Orbit radius = 6 + sqrt(childCount) × 2.5 (prevents overlap while keeping files close)
- Vertical spacing = 12 units (clear parent-child relationship)
- Bounding box calculation for automatic camera framing

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Port 3000 already in use"**
```bash
# Vite will automatically try 3001, 3002, etc.
# Or manually kill the process:
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill
```

**"Module not found" errors**
```bash
# Clean install dependencies
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

**Viewer shows empty/broken visualization**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify JSON file is in `viewer/public/data/`
- Clear browser cache (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Delete any `.js` files in `viewer/src/` (should only be `.ts`)

**Repository analysis crashes on large repos**
```bash
# Large repos may need more memory
NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=4096 npm run dev -- /path/to/repo
```

**Stale compiled `.js` files causing issues**
```bash
# Remove compiled artifacts
cd viewer && rm src/*.js
```

**Timeline V2 changes not appearing**
- Hard refresh browser: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux)
- Delete `viewer/dist/` directory
- Restart Vite dev server
